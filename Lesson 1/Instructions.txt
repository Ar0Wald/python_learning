Lesson 1: Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and is now one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of Python, including:

    Installing Python

    Running Python code

    Basic data types

    Variables

    Arithmetic operators

    Installing Python:
    To get started with Python, you'll need to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Follow the instructions for your operating system to install Python.

    Running Python code:
    Once you've installed Python, you can run it from the command line. Open a terminal window (on Windows, you can use the Command Prompt or PowerShell), and type "python" to start the Python interpreter. You should see the Python prompt ">>>".

    Basic data types:
    In Python, there are several basic data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings. Here are some examples:

    Integer: 5
    Float: 3.14
    Boolean: True or False
    String: "Hello, World!"

    Variables:
    Variables are used to store values in Python. You can assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=). Here's an example:


x = 5

In this example, we've created a variable named "x" and assigned the value 5 to it. You can then use the variable in other parts of your code.

    Arithmetic operators:
    Python supports several arithmetic operators, including addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). Here are some examples:


x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)    # Output: 8
print(x - y)    # Output: 2
print(x * y)    # Output: 15
print(x / y)    # Output: 1.6666666666666667
print(x % y)    # Output: 2

In this example, we've used the print() function to output the results of various arithmetic operations.

That's it for our first lesson! In the next lesson, we'll cover more advanced topics, including control structures, functions, and modules.
